# Fix Anthropic Version Conflict
**Date: June 30, 2025**
**Type: Bugfix**

## Overview
Fixed version conflict between anthropic package and pydantic-ai-slim requirements in client dependencies.

## Problem
The client installation was failing with:
```
The user requested anthropic==0.31.2
pydantic-ai-slim[anthropic,openai] 0.0.15 depends on anthropic>=0.40.0
```

The `pydantic-ai-slim` package requires a newer version of anthropic than we specified.

## Solution
Updated the client's requirements.txt to use minimum version specifiers for AI provider packages.

## Changes Made

### Updated client/requirements.txt

Changed from:
```txt
# AI Providers
openai==1.35.7
anthropic==0.31.2
```

To:
```txt
# AI Providers
openai>=1.35.7
anthropic>=0.40.0
```

## Benefits
1. **Compatibility** - Matches pydantic-ai-slim's requirements
2. **Flexibility** - Allows pip to find compatible versions
3. **Future updates** - Can use newer versions without manual changes
4. **Consistency** - Both AI providers use >= specifiers

## Full Updated Requirements

The client now uses:
- `fastapi>=0.115.12` - Latest FastAPI
- `uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.1` - ASGI server
- `websockets>=12.0` - WebSocket support
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.1` - Environment variables
- `httpx>=0.28.1` - HTTP client
- `pydantic-ai==0.0.15` - AI framework (pinned)
- `pydantic-ai-slim[openai,anthropic]==0.0.15` - AI framework slim (pinned)
- `aiosqlite` - Async SQLite
- `openai>=1.35.7` - OpenAI SDK
- `anthropic>=0.40.0` - Anthropic SDK

## Testing
After this change:
```bash
cd client
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Should install without conflicts
```

## Notes
- We keep pydantic-ai packages pinned to ensure stability
- Other packages use >= for flexibility
- The anthropic minimum version (0.40.0) is determined by pydantic-ai-slim
