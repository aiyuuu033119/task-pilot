```

## Main Branch Commands

```bash

git-merge-no-ff.md        # Merge develop â†’ main preserving history

# Version tagging
git-version-tag.md        # Creates release tags (v1.0.0)

# Hotfix workflow

git-hotfix-finish.md      # Merges to main & develop
git-hotfix-emergency.md   # Emergency production fixes
```

## General Branch Commands

```bash
# Branch management
git-branch-list.md        # List all branches
git-branch-delete.md      # Delete branches safely
git-branch-rename.md      # Rename branches
git-branch-protect.md     # Set protection rules

# Workflow
git-workflow-init.md      # Initialize main + develop
git-workflow-sync.md      # Sync all workflow branches

# Merging
git-merge-resolve.md      # Resolve conflicts
git-merge-squash.md       # Squash merge commits

# Version increment
git-version-increment.md  # Bump version numbers
```

## Usage Example

```bash
# Feature development flow
.claude/commands/git-feature-start.md new-login
.claude/commands/git-feature-update.md
.claude/commands/git-feature-finish.md

# Release flow
.claude/commands/git-version-tag.md v1.2.0
.claude/commands/git-merge-no-ff.md develop main

# Hotfix flow
.claude/commands/git-hotfix-start.md security-fix
.claude/commands/git-hotfix-finish.md
```

All commands include safety checks, validation, and follow the synchronized versioning strategy outlined in the Git Workflow Management document.

- **hotfix/** branches for urgent fixes (branched from main)

All commands use consistent naming conventions and include detailed error handling, validation steps, and safety notes.
