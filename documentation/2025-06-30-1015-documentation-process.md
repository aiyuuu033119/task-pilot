# Documentation Process Guide
**Created: June 30, 2025**

## Purpose
This guide establishes a standard process for documenting task executions and changes made to the project.

## Documentation Process

### 1. After Task Completion
When completing any significant task or set of changes:

1. **Create a summary** that includes:
   - Overview of what was done
   - Detailed list of changes made
   - Files affected
   - Any commands or scripts created
   - Benefits or improvements achieved
   - Any notes or warnings for future reference

2. **Save to documentation folder** with:
   - Filename format: `[YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM]-[description].md`
   - Examples (use current date):
     - `2025-06-30-1430-feature-auth-system.md`
     - `2025-06-30-1515-bugfix-websocket-error.md`
     - `2025-06-30-1600-refactor-database-schema.md`
     - `2025-06-30-1645-config-update-docker.md`
   - Use 24-hour format for time
   - Keep description concise but clear

### 2. Documentation Template

```markdown
# [Task Title]
**Date: [Month DD, YYYY]**
**Type: [Feature/Bugfix/Refactor/Configuration/Other]**

## Overview
[Brief description of what was accomplished]

## Changes Made

### 1. [Category of changes]
- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]
- [Include file paths where relevant]

### 2. [Another category]
- [Details]

## Files Modified
- `path/to/file1.py` - [What was changed]
- `path/to/file2.js` - [What was changed]

## New Files Created
- `path/to/newfile.py` - [Purpose]

## Commands/Scripts
```bash
# Any relevant commands used
```

## Testing
[How to verify the changes work]

## Notes
- [Any important considerations]
- [Potential issues to watch for]
- [Future improvements suggested]
```

### 3. Types of Tasks to Document

Always document:
- **Major feature additions**
- **Structural changes** (like reorganizing folders)
- **Configuration updates** (Docker, environment, etc.)
- **Bug fixes** that required investigation
- **Performance optimizations**
- **Security updates**
- **API changes**
- **Database migrations**

### 4. Benefits of This Process

1. **Knowledge preservation** - Future developers understand what was done
2. **Change tracking** - Easy to see project evolution
3. **Troubleshooting aid** - Historical context for debugging
4. **Onboarding help** - New team members can understand decisions
5. **Audit trail** - Track who did what and when

### 5. Best Practices

- **Be concise but complete** - Include all relevant details without unnecessary verbosity
- **Use clear filenames** - Make it easy to find specific documentation
- **Include examples** - Show actual code/commands where helpful
- **Link related docs** - Reference other documentation when relevant
- **Update existing docs** - If changes affect existing documentation, update it

### 6. Documentation Index

Consider maintaining an `INDEX.md` file that lists all documentation with brief descriptions:

```markdown
# Documentation Index

## 2025-01-30
- [project-restructure-2025-01-30.md](./project-restructure-2025-01-30.md) - Reorganized folder structure
- [documentation-process-2025-01-30.md](./documentation-process-2025-01-30.md) - Established documentation standards

## 2025-01-29
- [initial-setup-2025-01-29.md](./initial-setup-2025-01-29.md) - Initial project setup
```

## Example Usage

After completing a task like "Add user authentication", you would:

1. Create file: `documentation/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-feature-user-auth.md` (use current date/time)
2. Fill in the template with details of implementation
3. Update the INDEX.md if one exists
4. Commit the documentation along with code changes

Note: Use the current date and time when creating the file, not the example date/time shown.

This ensures every significant change is properly documented for future reference.
