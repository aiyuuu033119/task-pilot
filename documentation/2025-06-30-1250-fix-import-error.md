# Fix Import Error
**Date: June 30, 2025**
**Type: Bugfix**

## Overview
Fixed ImportError in client application caused by relative imports when running with uvicorn.

## Problem
When starting the client, it failed with:
```
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
```

This occurred because:
- The app.py file was using relative imports (`.conversation_agent`, `.database`, `.config`)
- When uvicorn runs `app:app`, it imports the module directly, not as part of a package
- Relative imports only work when the module is part of a package

## Solution
1. Changed all relative imports to absolute imports in app.py
2. Added PYTHONPATH configuration to run scripts

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed all relative imports in client directory
Changed all imports from relative to absolute in these files:
- `app.py`: Changed `.conversation_agent`, `.database`, `.config`
- `conversation_agent.py`: Changed `.config`
- `agent.py`: Changed `.config` and `.mcp_client`
- `database.py`: Changed `.config`
- `hybrid_agent.py`: Changed `.config`

Example change:
```python
# From:
from .config import config

# To:
from config import config
```

### 2. Updated client/run.sh
Added PYTHONPATH export:
```bash
# Set PYTHONPATH to current directory
export PYTHONPATH="${PWD}:${PYTHONPATH}"
```

### 3. Updated client/run.bat
Added PYTHONPATH setting:
```batch
REM Set PYTHONPATH to current directory
set PYTHONPATH=%CD%;%PYTHONPATH%
```

## Why This Works
- Absolute imports work when the module's directory is in PYTHONPATH
- The run scripts now add the current directory to PYTHONPATH
- This allows Python to find the modules without needing relative imports

## Alternative Solutions (Not Used)
1. Could have run as module: `python -m client.app`
2. Could have added `__init__.py` and restructured as package
3. Could have used sys.path manipulation

We chose the simplest solution that requires minimal changes.

## Testing
After these changes:
```bash
cd client
./run.sh  # Should start without import errors
```

## Notes
- This is a common issue when transitioning from development to deployment
- The PYTHONPATH approach is clean and doesn't modify the code structure
- All imports in the client directory should use absolute imports
