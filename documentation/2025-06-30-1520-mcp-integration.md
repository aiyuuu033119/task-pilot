# MCP Tools Integration
**Date: June 30, 2025**
**Type: Feature**

## Overview
Successfully integrated Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools into the conversation agent, enabling the AI to access and use tools from the MCP server.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated conversation_agent.py
- Added `MCPClient` import
- Created MCP client instance in `__init__`
- Added two new tools:
  - `list_mcp_tools`: Lists all available MCP server tools
  - `call_mcp_tool`: Calls a specific tool from the MCP server
- Updated `__aenter__` to initialize MCP client and check server health
- Updated `__aexit__` to properly close MCP client

### 2. MCP Tools Available
The MCP server provides these tools:
- **calculator**: Evaluate mathematical expressions
- **get_current_time**: Get current date/time
- **get_weather**: Get weather information (currently mock data)
- **web_search**: Search the web (simplified DuckDuckGo)
- **save_note/get_notes**: Note-taking functionality

### 3. How It Works
1. The client connects to the MCP server on startup
2. When the AI needs to use an MCP tool, it calls `call_mcp_tool` with the tool name and arguments
3. The MCP client sends a JSON-RPC request to the server
4. The server executes the tool and returns the result
5. The AI incorporates the result into its response

### 4. Testing
Created `test_mcp_tools.py` to verify integration:
```bash
cd client
python test_mcp_tools.py
```

## Usage Examples

### List Available Tools
```
User: What MCP tools are available?
AI: [Uses list_mcp_tools to show available tools]
```

### Use Calculator
```
User: Calculate 25 * 4 using the MCP calculator
AI: [Uses call_mcp_tool with tool_name="calculator" and arguments={"expression": "25 * 4"}]
```

### Get Weather
```
User: What's the weather in London?
AI: [Uses call_mcp_tool with tool_name="get_weather" and arguments={"location": "London"}]
```

## Configuration
The MCP server URL is configured in `.env`:
```
MCP_SERVER_HOST=localhost
MCP_SERVER_PORT=8001
```

## Benefits
1. **Extensibility**: New tools can be added to the MCP server without modifying the client
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Tools are managed independently in the MCP server
3. **Flexibility**: The AI can discover and use tools dynamically
4. **Scalability**: MCP server can be deployed separately and scaled independently

## Next Steps
- Add more sophisticated tools to the MCP server
- Implement real weather API integration
- Add database query tools
- Implement file system tools (with proper security)
